# Block

App.java takes a series of plain text files as input and will create blocks with appropriate headers and chain them together. It's the start of a novice blockchain!

## About

`sample-generator.py` will generate sample text files under `block/files` labelled ledgerX.txt with X being an integer up to 5 (by default). The python file has configuration variables at the top

The output file generated by App.java will have the first file's name with `.block.out` appended to it, this is located in the root

## Usage

To compile: Run `sh recompile.sh`

To run: Place the text file of accounts and balances into `block/files` or run `python sample-generator.py`. Run the run bash scripts depending on the level of verbosity you prefer

To clear files: Run `sh reset-io.sh`. This will delete all `.txt` files and `.out` files, which is what is generated by App.java, a human readable representation of the blockchain
