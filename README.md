# Block

App.java takes a series of plain text files as input and will create blocks with appropriate headers and chain them together. It's the start of a novice blockchain!

## About

`sample-generator.py` will generate sample text files under `block/files` labelled ledgerX.txt with X being an integer up to 5 (by default). The python file has configuration variables at the top

The output file generated by App.java will have the first file's name with `.block.out` appended to it, this is located in the root

## Usage

A Makefile has been provided to make running the program easier.

Default commands:

- `make` or `make all` - Compile the Java files, create sample input files and runs the program
- `make clean` - Deletes all input files and java compiled `*.class` files

Individual steps:

- `make get-samples` - Generate input text samples
- `make recompile` - Compile the java files
- `make reset-io` - Removes all input (\*.txt) and output (\*.out) files
- `make rm-class` - Removes all `*.class` files
- `make run` - Same as `make all`
- `make run-verbose` - Same as `make run` or `make all`, except the output file will list out all accounts contained in the block
